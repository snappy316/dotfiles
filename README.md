# David's Dotfiles

We're now using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)!

## Install
On a fresh macOS install, open a terminal, and run the following commands:
```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/snappy316/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
$ cd .dotfiles
$ ./dev-install work
```

(I'm still working on a single-command clone-and-install path, which uses the `./install` script...meaning `./dev-install` after manually cloning is the way to go for now.)
