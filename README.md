# David's Dotfiles

We're now using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)!

## Install
On a fresh macOS install, open a terminal, and run the following commands:
```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/snappy316/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
$ cd .dotfiles
$ ./dev-install macos
```

(I'm still working on a single-command clone-and-install path, which uses the `./install` script...meaning `./dev-install` after manually cloning is the way to go for now.)

## Configuration Inspirations
- Originally heavily inspired by [Ryan's config files](https://github.com/ryansobol/config/) and the [Ruby Foundations class setup files](https://github.com/codefellows/sea-c21-ruby/tree/master/lib/class1/osx)
- [`bweave/dotfiles`](https://github.com/bweave/dotfiles)
